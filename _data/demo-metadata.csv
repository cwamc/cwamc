The recording is very quiet during a lot of scenes, and audience rustling (and constant coughing – so glad the FOH staff kept ‘reminding’ us we didn’t ~have to~ wear masks anymore...) didn’t help. Also, I’m sure the non-miked(?) portions worked great at the original Broadway venue, but unfortunately not so much in a giant touring house like this (and I set in front orchestra). Apparently it was especially bad that night cause there was a 10-minute technical pause during “Lonely Room”. At this point, there was a mass exodus of confused/bored/upset patrons who apparently did not know what they signed up for. It took 2 tries to restart (I cut out the 10 min pause but you get to enjoy my “oh come on” when the mic still doesn’t work), but they got back on track and wrapped up Act 1; at intermission some of the more polite boomers left too, leaving the house pretty much half-empty (it was almost full at the start of the show). Act 2 went without an issue, PLUS we got to self-upgrade from side to center orchestra, PLUS the remaining audience was much better. ANYWAYS, the show itself left a deep impression on me – I knew what I was going in for, and now I’m even more curious to see a “traditional” staging. It was my first time experiencing Oklahoma! aside from knowing some of the songs, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
